and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Remove `INFO` section attribute from `eh_frame` + `eh_fram_hdr` in `link.x`

## [v0.13.0] - 2024-10-19

### Added

- Add integration tests to check that macros work as expected.
- Add `no-exceptions` feature to opt-out the default implementation of `_dispatch_exception`
- Add `no-interrupts` feature to opt-out the default implementation of `_dispatch_core_interrupt`
- Add `pre_init_trap` to detect early errors during the boot process.
- Add `v-trap` feature to enable interrupt handling in vectored mode.
- Add `core_interrupt` proc macro to help defining core interrupt handlers.
  If `v-trap` feature is enabled, this macro also generates its corresponding trap.
- Add `external_interrupt` proc macro to help defining external interrupt handlers.
- Add `exception` proc macro to help defining exception handlers.
  If `v-trap` feature is enabled, this macro also generates its corresponding trap.
- Add `u-boot` feature, so that you can start your elf binary with u-boot and
work with passed arguments.

### Changed

- Use `cfg_attr` in `start_trap_rust` to allow compilation in non-riscv targets.
- Moved all the assembly code to `asm.rs`
- Use `weak` symbols for functions such as `_mp_hook` or `_start_trap`
- `abort` is now `weak`, so it is possible to link third-party libraries including this symbol.
- Made `cfg` variable selection more robust for custom targets
- `_start_trap_rust` now relies on `_dispatch_exception` and `_dispatch_core_interrupt`.
  This change allows more flexibility for targets with non-standard exceptions and interrupts.
- Upgrade rust-version to 1.61
- Update `syn` to version 2.0

### Removed

- `start_rust` is no longer needed, as it is now written in assembly
- `default_*` symbols are no longer needed, as we use `weak` symbols now.

## [v0.12.2] - 2024-02-15

### Added

- Implementation of `default_mp_hook` when `single-hart` feature is enabled.

## [v0.12.1] - 2024-01-24

### Added

- Patch in assembly code to avoid spurious errors from LLVM

## [v0.12.0] - 2024-01-14

### Added

- Add `links` field in `Cargo.toml`
- Add FPU initialization
- Static array for vectored-like handling of exceptions
- New GitHub workflow for checking invalid labels in PRs
- New GitHub workflow for checking modifications on CHANGELOG.md
- New GitHub workflow for checking clippy lints in PRs
- Optional cargo feature `single-hart` for single CPU targets

### Changed

- Removed _start_rust. Now, assembly directly jumps to main
- Removed U-mode interrupts to align with latest RISC-V specification
- Changed `Vector` union. Now, it uses `Option<fn>`, which is more idiomatic in Rust
- Removed riscv-target dependency for build
- Upgrade rust-version to 1.60
- Cargo workspace for riscv and riscv-rt
- Use inline assembly instead of pre-compiled blobs
- Removed bors in favor of GitHub Merge Queue
- `start_trap_rust` is now marked as `unsafe`
- Implement `r0` as inline assembly
- Use `${ARCH_WIDTH}` in `link.x.in` to adapt to different archs
- mhartid CSR is no longer read in single-hart mode, assumed zero
- Ensure stack pointer is 16-byte aligned before jumping to Rust entry point

## [v0.11.0] - 2023-01-18

### Changed

- Update `riscv` to version 0.10.1 fixing a critical section bug

## [v0.10.0] - 2022-11-04

### Added

- Optional cargo feature `s-mode` for supervisor mode, including conditional compilation for supervisor/machine mode instructions.

### Changed

- Remove superfluous parentheses from link.x, which caused linker errors with nightly.
- Changed `mp_hook` signature, hartid as passed as usize parameter by the caller (required for `s-mode` feature).
- Update `riscv` to version 0.9

## [v0.9.0] - 2022-07-01

### Added

- Pass `a0..a2` register values to the `#[entry]` function.

### Changed

- Update `riscv` to version 0.8
- Update `riscv-rt-macros` to 0.2.0
- Update Minimum Supported Rust Version to 1.59
- The main symbol is no longer randomly generated in the `#[entry]` macro, instead it uses `__risc_v_rt__main`.

### Removed

- Remove `inline-asm` feature which is now always enabled

## [v0.8.1] - 2022-01-25

### Added
